    <h2>Unicode Text Rendering Reference System</h2>
	<p>
		A system to compare a reference image of a text character, word or phrase with another image of the character, word or phrase that was rendered by a text rendering engine. Differences between the reference image and the rendered image may be recorded for subsequent analysis. Performance of a text rendering engine producing text according to typographical rules applicable to a natural language can be evaluated by one with no knowledge or ability to read the natural language.
